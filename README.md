# PHNet: Patch-based Normalization for Image Harmonization

We present a patch-based harmonization network consisting of novel Patch-based normalization (PN) blocks and a feature extractor based on statistical color transfer. We evaluate our approach on available image harmonization datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the network's high generalization capability for different domains. Additionally, we collected a new dataset focused on portrait harmonization. Our network achieves state-of-the-art results on iHarmony4 and gains the best metrics on the synthetic portrait dataset.

## Installation
Clone and install required python packages:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/befozg/PHNet.git
cd PHNet
# Create virtual env by conda from env.yml file
conda create -f env.yml
conda activate phnet

# or install packages using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
We present Flickr-Faces-HQ-Harmonization (FFHQH), a new dataset for portrait harmonization based on the [FFHQ](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset). It contains real images, foreground masks, and synthesized composites.

## Model Zoo
Also, we provide some pre-trained models called PHNet for demo usage.

To run complete portrait transfer demo, also refer to [StyleMatte](https://github.com/befozg/stylematte) to download matting network checkpoints. Place them in `checkpoints/` directory.

## Train [TODO]
You can use downloaded trained models, otherwise select the baseline and parameters for training`.
To train the model, execute the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

Refer to our ```config/train.yaml```  for training details.

## Test
To test the model, execute the following command:

```bash
python test.py
```
Refer to our ```config/test.yaml``` for inference details.

## Run demo
To run the demo app locally, execute the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

Refer to our ```config/demo.yaml``` for demo details.
You can enable link sharing option to create global link in ```app.py```. Then follow to ```http://127.0.0.1:7860``` on your localhost to try out the application.
